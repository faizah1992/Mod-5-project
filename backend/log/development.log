Zeitwerk::NameError (wrong constant name Orders.Controller inferred by Module from file

  /Users/faizahAhsan/Desktop/Flatironlabs/Mod-5-project/backend/app/controllers/orders._controller.rb

Possible ways to address this:

  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore this particular file.
  * Tell Zeitwerk to ignore one of its parent directories.
  * Rename the file to comply with the naming conventions.
  * Modify the inflector to handle this case.
